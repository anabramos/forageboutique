## About Forage Boutique
Forage Boutique is a web application targeted at Amsterdam-based individuals who are interested in purchasing plants. As a full-stack e-commerce web application this project was built using Django, Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is a B2C (Business to Customer) designed to create better user experience to clients and provide useful management tools for the business owner.

## UX/UI
Using core Design Thinking methods and Agile practices principles the strategy for this web application takes into consideration 2 personas: Business Owner and Client, and their respective needs. 

### User Stories

All user stories are documented with their respective acceptance criteria, story points and MoSCoW prioritization on [my Github Issues](https://github.com/anabramos/forageboutique/issues) or on [this excell google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tIHWxuTbgwAMaqZkwu3j8kelPhfHuCNg/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116746214337321598702&rtpof=true&sd=true)

### Agile Practices

#### Wireframes
- All wireframes were designed with Canva tool. These can be found here. Final web application will differ slightly from wireframes as it will utilize more similar structures between different pages for better visual appeal and user experience.

#### Product Backlog & Project Board
- I created my product backlog using [my Github labels](https://github.com/anabramos/forageboutique/issues) with different colors, dividing user stories clusters more or less equally per iteration/epic. This however did not translate the build up order of the project, as I had overestimated how some tasks and features are dependent from others to being build.  
- For information radiators I have made use of [my Github Projects](https://github.com/anabramos/forageboutique/projects/1)
